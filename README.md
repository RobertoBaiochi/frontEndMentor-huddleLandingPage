## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I'm still focusing a lot on responsiveness, in this challenge I also tried the landscapes as best I could, so it took a while :)

### Continued development

I'll keep focusing on Media Queries until it's clear in my mind how to work the layout completely.
